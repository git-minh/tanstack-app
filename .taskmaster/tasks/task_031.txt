# Task ID: 31
# Title: Advanced Performance Optimizations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: low
# Description: Implement service worker caching, SSG, and progressive enhancement
# Details:
Advanced techniques for edge performance.

Implementations:
1. Add Workbox for service worker generation
2. Cache static assets (CSS, JS, fonts)
3. Implement runtime caching for API responses
4. Add offline fallback pages
5. Implement SSG for marketing pages (pricing, landing)
6. Optimize SSR hydration performance
7. Consider partial hydration for heavy components

Expected impact: Offline support, faster repeat visits, better reliability

# Test Strategy:
Test offline functionality. Verify cache strategies. Measure hydration time. Test SSG pages load fast.
