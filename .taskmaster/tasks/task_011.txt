# Task ID: 11
# Title: Performance Optimization - Response Time Monitoring
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: low
# Description: Implement monitoring and logging for AI generation performance
# Details:
Add timing logs to track API call duration, parsing time, and batch creation time. Log all requests for debugging and optimization. Monitor for performance issues.

# Test Strategy:
Review logs to identify bottlenecks. Verify all stages are timed correctly.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Add timing instrumentation to action [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add console.log statements with timestamps for each major step
### Details:
Log: Start time, API call start/end, parsing start/end, project creation, task creation, contact creation, total time.

## 2. Implement request/response logging [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Log all AI requests and responses for debugging
### Details:
Log: User prompt, AI response (truncated if large), success/failure, error messages, generated item counts.

## 3. Add performance alerts for slow requests [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up monitoring for requests exceeding 30 seconds
### Details:
Log warnings for slow AI calls. Track P50, P95, P99 response times. Consider adding Sentry or similar for alerting.
