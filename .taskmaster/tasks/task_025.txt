# Task ID: 25
# Title: Vendor Bundle Optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Reduce vendor chunks by 40% through selective loading and alternatives
# Details:
Current vendor sizes:
- vendor-forms: 258 KB (react-hook-form + Zod)
- vendor-charts: 243 KB (Recharts)
- vendor-auth: 186 KB (Better-Auth)
- vendor-ui: 100 KB (Radix UI)

Strategies:
1. Lazy load form libraries (only complex forms need RHF + Zod)
2. Audit Recharts usage (already lazy loaded, but 243 KB is huge)
3. Split auth bundle (only load on /login route)
4. Remove unused Radix components and variants
5. Split date-fns into separate chunk

Expected impact: 30% additional reduction, faster route transitions

# Test Strategy:
Analyze bundle composition. Test form functionality. Verify chart loads correctly. Measure vendor chunk sizes.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Analyze and lazy load form libraries (258 KB) [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Split react-hook-form and Zod into separate chunks, load only for complex forms
### Details:
Identify simple vs complex forms. Simple forms (login, search): use native useState. Complex forms (task/project creation): keep RHF + Zod but lazy load. Update Vite config to create vendor-forms chunk only loaded when needed.

## 2. Audit Recharts usage and consider lighter alternatives [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Evaluate if 243 KB Recharts is necessary or can be replaced
### Details:
Verify Recharts is already lazy loaded (good!). Count chart types used. Research alternatives: Chart.js (50 KB), visx (80 KB). Document decision: keep if critical, replace if savings worth migration effort.

## 3. Split auth bundle to only load on login route [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Ensure Better-Auth (186 KB) only loads when needed
### Details:
Update Vite config manualChunks. Create vendor-auth chunk. Verify auth components only load on _auth routes. Test authentication still works correctly. Measure bundle size improvement for authenticated routes.

## 4. Remove unused Radix UI components and variants [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Audit and remove rarely-used UI primitives (100 KB → ~70 KB)
### Details:
Search for unused Radix components: Tabs, RadioGroup, ToggleGroup, etc. Remove imports and component files if unused. Check if all component variants are needed. Update manual chunks to optimize Radix bundle.

## 5. Extract date-fns and optimize Vite manual chunks [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create separate chunk for date utilities and optimize all vendor chunks
### Details:
Add date-fns to manual chunks in vite.config.ts. Optimize chunk splitting for AI generation features. Create chunks: vendor-dates, vendor-ai-generation. Test all chunks load correctly. Verify chunk sizes are 20-50 KB ideal range.

## 6. Measure vendor bundle optimization results [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Verify 40% vendor chunk reduction achieved
### Details:
Run production build. Compare before/after: vendor-forms (258→180 KB), vendor-charts (243 KB, already optimized), vendor-auth (186→130 KB), vendor-ui (100→70 KB). Document total savings and impact on load times.
