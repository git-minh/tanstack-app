# Task ID: 28
# Title: Build Configuration Optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enhance Vite config for optimal chunking and compression
# Details:
Improve build output for better caching and loading.

Enhancements:
1. Create manual chunks for heavy features (AI generation, tables)
2. Extract date-fns into separate chunk
3. Split TanStack Router/Query into core chunk
4. Optimize chunk sizes (20-50 KB ideal)
5. Enable CSS minification and tree shaking
6. Configure Brotli compression on Cloudflare Workers
7. Add preload/prefetch hints for critical chunks

Expected impact: Better caching, faster repeat visits, optimal resource loading

# Test Strategy:
Analyze build output. Test cache invalidation. Measure repeat visit performance. Verify production builds.
