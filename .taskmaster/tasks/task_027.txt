# Task ID: 27
# Title: Data Fetching Optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Optimize Convex queries with indexes, caching, and selective field loading
# Details:
Improve data fetching performance with React Query + Convex.

Optimizations:
1. Verify all queries have proper indexes (by_userId, compound indexes)
2. Configure staleTime: 5 minutes for infrequently changing data
3. Set cacheTime: 10 minutes for expensive queries
4. Implement optimistic updates for mutations
5. Use selective field queries (don't over-fetch)
6. Add route-level data prefetching
7. Profile slow queries in Convex dashboard

Expected impact: Faster page transitions, reduced server load, better perceived performance

# Test Strategy:
Profile query performance in Convex dashboard. Test with network throttling. Verify cache invalidation works. Measure LCP improvement.
