# Task ID: 26
# Title: React Rendering Optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement memoization and virtual scrolling to improve runtime performance
# Details:
Optimize React rendering to reduce unnecessary re-renders and improve perceived performance.

Key optimizations:
1. Wrap expensive table components with React.memo
2. Implement virtual scrolling for tables with >50 rows (@tanstack/react-virtual)
3. Memoize table columns and data transformations (useMemo)
4. Debounce search/filter inputs (300ms)
5. Throttle table updates (150ms)
6. Split large contexts (LayoutProvider, ThemeProvider)
7. Profile components with React DevTools Profiler

Expected impact: Smoother interactions, faster table rendering, reduced CPU usage

# Test Strategy:
Profile before/after with React DevTools. Test with large datasets (100+ items). Measure FPS during scrolling. Verify no functionality broken.
