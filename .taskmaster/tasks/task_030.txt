# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: low
# Description: Reduce CSS bundle size through Tailwind optimization and critical CSS extraction
# Details:
Optimize CSS loading and reduce bundle size.

Optimizations:
1. Audit used Tailwind classes and purge unused
2. Disable unused Tailwind features and plugins
3. Extract critical CSS for above-the-fold content
4. Inline critical CSS for first paint
5. Defer loading of non-critical styles
6. Analyze index.css for unused styles

Expected impact: Faster First Contentful Paint (FCP), reduced style recalculation

# Test Strategy:
Measure CSS bundle size. Test critical CSS extraction. Verify styles render correctly. Profile style recalculation.
