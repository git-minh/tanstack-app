# TanStack Start Hackathon - Missing Sponsor Integrations PRD

## Overview
Complete the required sponsor integrations for the TanStack Start Hackathon submission. Deadline: November 17, 2025 at 12:00 PM PT. Current readiness: 6/10. Target: 8.5-9/10.

## Context
The app already has excellent TanStack Start + Convex implementation with a unique AI project generation feature using Azure OpenAI. We're missing 3 critical sponsor integrations (Firecrawl, Sentry, Autumn) and need to properly configure CodeRabbit.

## Required Integrations

### 1. Sentry Error Monitoring (Priority 1 - 30 min)
**Goal:** Implement comprehensive error tracking and performance monitoring.

**Requirements:**
- Install @sentry/react and @sentry/vite-plugin packages
- Initialize Sentry in apps/web/src/router.tsx with proper configuration
- Add Sentry Vite plugin to vite.config.ts for source map upload
- Configure browser tracing and session replay integrations
- Set up environment variable VITE_SENTRY_DSN
- Test error tracking by triggering intentional error
- Verify errors appear in Sentry dashboard
- Add error boundaries to critical components
- Configure performance monitoring with tracesSampleRate
- Set up user context tracking (userId, email)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Errors automatically captured and sent to Sentry
- Source maps uploaded for readable stack traces
- User sessions can be replayed
- Performance metrics tracked
- Environment variables documented in docs/ENVIRONMENT.md

### 2. Firecrawl Web Scraping (Priority 2 - 1.5-2 hours)
**Goal:** Integrate Firecrawl to scrape websites and feed content to AI generation.

**Requirements:**
- Install @firecrawl/firecrawl-node in packages/backend
- Create Convex action: scrapeUrl in packages/backend/convex/ai.ts
- Configure Firecrawl with FIRECRAWL_API_KEY environment variable
- Add "Import from URL" input field to GenerateDialog component
- Implement URL validation (must be valid HTTP/HTTPS URL)
- Add scraping loading state with progress indicator
- Call scrapeUrl action before AI generation when URL provided
- Append scraped markdown content to user prompt
- Handle scraping errors gracefully (invalid URL, timeout, rate limit)
- Test with various URLs: GitHub READMEs, documentation sites, blog posts
- Add character limit for scraped content (max 10,000 chars)
- Show scraped content preview to user before generation

**Use Cases:**
- User pastes GitHub repo URL → Scrapes README → Generates project structure
- User pastes documentation URL → Extracts content → Creates implementation tasks
- User provides project spec URL → Parses requirements → Builds complete project

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- URL input field integrated into GenerateDialog
- Firecrawl successfully scrapes markdown from URLs
- Scraped content enhances AI generation quality
- Error handling for failed scrapes
- Environment variable documented

### 3. Autumn Pricing/Billing (Priority 3 - 1 hour)
**Goal:** Add subscription billing with usage-based limits for AI generation.

**Requirements:**
- Install @autumnhq/autumn-js in apps/web
- Create pricing page at apps/web/src/routes/_authenticated/pricing.tsx
- Define pricing tiers: Free (5 AI generations/month), Pro ($9/month unlimited)
- Add usage tracking to Convex: aiGenerations counter per user
- Create Convex query: getUserUsage returning generation count and limit
- Implement usage limit check before AI generation
- Show upgrade prompt when free users hit limit
- Create Autumn checkout session integration
- Add VITE_AUTUMN_API_KEY environment variable
- Create subscription management in user settings
- Add "Upgrade to Pro" button in GenerateDialog for free users
- Track subscription status in Convex user table
- Handle webhook for subscription status updates
- Add pricing tier badge to user profile

**Pricing Page Components:**
- Pricing tiers comparison table

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Free users limited to 5 AI generations
- Pro users have unlimited generations
- Checkout flow works end-to-end (test mode)
- Usage counter updates correctly
- Pricing page accessible from sidebar
- Subscription status persisted in database

### 4. CodeRabbit Configuration (Priority 4 - 15 min)
**Goal:** Properly configure CodeRabbit for AI-powered code reviews.

**Requirements:**
- Create .coderabbit.yml configuration file in project root
- Enable auto_review for pull requests
- Configure request_changes_workflow
- Enable chat auto_reply feature
- Set language to English
- Document CodeRabbit setup in README.md
- Add CodeRabbit configuration section to CLAUDE.md
- Update README with CodeRabbit integration details
- Verify badge already present in README
- Test with sample pull request (if possible)

**Configuration:**
- Auto-review: enabled for all PRs
- Skip drafts: true
- Request changes workflow: enabled
- Chat: enabled with auto-reply

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- .coderabbit.yml file created with proper config
- Configuration documented in project docs
- README updated with integration details

## Testing & Quality Assurance

### Integration Testing (45 min)
**Goal:** Test all sponsor integrations end-to-end.

**Requirements:**
- Test Sentry: Trigger error → Verify dashboard → Check source maps
- Test Firecrawl: Scrape 3 different URLs → Verify content quality
- Test Autumn: Complete checkout flow in test mode → Verify webhook
- Test CodeRabbit: Review configuration validity
- Test all integrations together in complete user flow
- Verify environment variables in production
- Check for console errors or warnings
- Test mobile responsiveness for new components
- Verify accessibility (keyboard navigation, ARIA labels)
- Load testing for concurrent AI generations

**Test Scenarios:**
1. Free user hits generation limit → Sees upgrade prompt → Completes checkout
2. User provides GitHub URL → Firecrawl scrapes → AI generates project
3. Error occurs during generation → Sentry captures → User sees friendly message
4. Pro user generates unlimited projects → Usage tracked correctly

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All integrations work independently
- All integrations work together
- No console errors
- Mobile-friendly UI

## Risk Mitigation

**Risks:**
1. API rate limits (Firecrawl, Azure OpenAI)
   - Mitigation: Implement caching, usage limits
2. Integration complexity (Autumn webhooks)
   - Mitigation: Use test mode, simplify MVP
3. Video quality
   - Mitigation: Practice run, use good microphone
4. Deployment issues
   - Mitigation: Deploy early, test thoroughly

**Fallback Plan:**
- If integration fails, document in video and show partial implementation
- Focus on quality over quantity - better to have 3 perfect integrations than 4 broken ones
- Have backup video ready in case re-recording needed

## Technical Notes

**Existing Architecture to Leverage:**
- AI generation already uses Azure OpenAI - integrate Firecrawl here
- User authentication already in place - use for usage tracking
- Convex real-time already working - use for subscription updates
- CircleCI pipeline ready - just add environment variables

**Potential Challenges:**
- Firecrawl API rate limits - need to handle gracefully
- Autumn webhook verification - may need test mode only
- Sentry source maps - ensure build configuration correct
- Video recording - need quiet environment and stable app
